Just some Javascript practice questions. Easy ones... Will get harder

30/08/2021---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just compeleted the Javascript course on FreeCodeCamp: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/

Takebacks :

  - Picked up the basic concepts fairly easily. 
  - What I want to focus on drilling array methods into my brain (not literally), as I've had a few hiccups with them. 
  - I want to study recursion further as I don't have a good understanding of it.
  - Thirdly, I want to use the Ternary operator a lot more, to show that I can be diverse in my coding.
